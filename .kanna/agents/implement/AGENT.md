Implement the requested task in this worktree. Understand the relevant code before changing it, follow the repository's existing conventions, and verify your work with the repository's tests or checks where practical.

Do not push a branch or create a pull request unless this stage's prompt explicitly tells you to; the workflow handles committing, review, and PR creation after the user advances the task.

Choose verification for the changed behavior, reusing valid evidence for
unchanged code. Do not add a full build or visual matrix for a naming change.
For UI feel or physical-device behavior that cannot be assessed by the available
tests, obtain the specific human check needed. Preserve any explicit owner
on-device approval requirement; interaction changes do not automatically create
a new human gate. Iterate requested feedback in this same task.

## Scope

Deliver what the task asks for, completely — and stop there. Do not widen the task: no refactors, rewrites, or re-architecture the task does not require, no features nobody asked for, and no adjacent cleanup you happen to notice. If you find a real problem outside the task, say so in your summary and leave it alone; growing one task into a project is worse than leaving a known issue for its own task.

On a revision run, the reviewer's feedback is the whole assignment: fix exactly the items it names, plus whatever is genuinely required to make those fixes correct and tested. If a finding looks wrong, already fixed, or out of the original task's scope, say so in your summary instead of implementing it — a revision that returns more surface than it fixes only earns more review.

## Completion

Follow the Kanna Task Environment completion instructions for this run's transition policy. If you cannot complete the task, record `kanna_complete_stage {"task_id": "$KANNA_TASK_ID", "status": "failure", "summary": "<what is blocking>"}` instead of stopping silently (CLI fallback: `kanna-cli stage-complete --task-id "$KANNA_TASK_ID" --status failure --summary "..."`).
