//! Shutting the source agent down so its conversation can be shipped.
//!
//! The old mechanism was a single `SIGINT` to the source session followed by a
//! 1500 ms wait. It could not work, for a reason that only shows up after an
//! app upgrade: the daemon **refuses signals for adopted sessions** — sessions
//! it inherited through handoff, where it holds the master fd but never forked
//! the child, so the pid cannot be pinned across `kill(2)`
//! (`crates/daemon/src/pty.rs`). It fails closed by design. Every session older
//! than the running daemon is adopted, so after every upgrade no pre-existing
//! task could be finalized at all. On 2026-08-06 that is exactly what happened:
//! `[handoff] adopted session …` at 10:43, the signal refused at 13:43.
//!
//! Injected input has none of that constraint.
//! `Command::SubmitInputIfSessionIdle` accepts a lifecycle message for an
//! adopted session while fencing it to the PTY process observed at attach and
//! atomically requiring the daemon's current status to be positively idle. So
//! finalization *asks* the agent to stop instead of signalling it:
//!
//! 1. wait for the current turn to reach an observed `Idle`;
//! 2. inject a wrap-up message and wait for the daemon's delivery acknowledgement;
//! 3. require the provider to emit this transfer's completion marker, then
//!    reach settled `Idle` after an observed `Busy`;
//! 4. inject the provider's quit command (`/exit`, `/quit` for Codex);
//! 5. wait for the daemon `Exit`.
//!
//! On the clean path, only then are artifacts staged, which is also what fixes
//! Codex: its rollout under `~/.codex/sessions` is nameable long before the
//! process exits but is still growing at that point, so the old mid-session
//! staging shipped a truncated conversation (pinned by
//! `tests/cli-contract/tests/live/codex-rollout-timing.test.ts`).
//!
//! The marker is deliberately absent from the submitted bytes, so an echoed
//! prompt or an unrelated `Busy` → `Idle` cycle cannot impersonate completion.
//! A quiet composer is not completion: if the daemon never observes the marker
//! and a settled idle state, finalization degrades and leaves the session alive
//! rather than appending a quit command to an unsubmitted prompt.
//! A pre-existing phase claim or uncertain delivery likewise never releases the
//! quit.
//!
//! **`Waiting` is not `Idle`, and nothing may be typed while it holds.** It
//! means the agent is parked on a permission prompt, which consumes the next
//! input as its *answer* — and the submission policy ends every message with a
//! CR, which is exactly the keystroke that accepts the prompt's
//! highlighted option. Approving a pending tool call on the operator's behalf
//! is not something a transfer may do, and it would be silent: the agent would
//! resume, reach `Idle`, quit on cue, and ship `cleanlyFinalized: true` with
//! nothing anywhere saying a tool call had been approved.
//!
//! Preparation requires a positively observed idle status, and quit
//! additionally requires the causal marker and settled-idle boundary. A
//! session already parked when
//! finalization starts degrades on the spot rather than waiting: nobody is
//! going to answer that prompt — the operator is in the
//! middle of pushing the task away from this machine — so waiting out the
//! wrap-up budget would buy minutes of user-visible latency and reach the same
//! verdict. A session that parks *during* the wrap-up reaches the same rung
//! through the idle timeout. Pushing a task that is parked on a prompt is a
//! normal thing to do; it is often *why* someone pushes it, and the destination
//! resumes with the prompt still to answer.
//!
//! The ladder, each rung loud and recorded on the transfer:
//!
//! - injection failure, or the session never reaching `Idle`, degrades the
//!   finalization: artifacts are staged from the transcript as it stands and
//!   the payload carries `cleanlyFinalized: false` plus the reason. That rung
//!   only ships a conversation because Claude appends to its transcript while
//!   the session runs, which is pinned by
//!   `tests/cli-contract/tests/live/claude-transcript-append.test.ts`.
//! - destructive teardown stays the last resort and stays *after* staging: the
//!   source task's session is killed by `close_task_in_process` once the
//!   destination acknowledges the import (`push::outgoing_committed`), which is
//!   a SIGKILL sweep authenticated by the master fd and therefore works on
//!   adopted sessions. Finalization does not duplicate it — killing here would
//!   destroy a live agent for a transfer that may still fail.
